# Hexercise

This is a thing that I am using to learn how to make apps, and typescripty stuff

Currently using:
    * Deno
    * Fresh
    * Supabase
    * Drizzle

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation. Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

If you don't have Supabase installed you will have to get one running locally while I build this mess:

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker
and you will need to update the docker-config so that you are able to access it with the values in the drizzle.config.ts

currently the data is put in by hand, when I get a better corpus I will probably auto-populate it with something in here
