Updating DB schema in 
  @db/schema.ts
  requires a run of `deno task db:setup` in order to generate the schema change migration file and a `deno task db:migrate` in order for the tables in supabase to be updated

Todo:
  * [ ] is there a way to clean up the state of the schema migrations? I think I only need the last one...
    * Yeah but not for dev. just keep it ugly until we have a 1.0
  * [X] Add more Exercises MuscleGroups

  * [ ] Autofill the excercises through the DB to the front-end
  * [ ] Auth
  * [ ] Pretty version migrated form shadcn-test




Scratch:

    Training Day should have a day of the week. Which we map over several weeks to complete a mesocycle

    Back focused Mesocycle -> 14 sets / week on targeted muscle group (Lats, Erectors)...
    Arm focuses Mesocycle -> 14+ sets /week on targeted muscle group (triceps, biceps, delts)

  Mesocycle Muscle Groups Focus,
    
    Training Day should have Muscle Groups to target, with specific exercises for 

  on l:11 14sets / training days per mesocycle (14 / int(5))

  Monday:
    Skull Crushers 
      s0 -> 25lbs [15reps] (2 rir)
      s1 -> 25lbs [15reps] (2 rir)
      s2 -> 25lbs [13reps] (2 rir)

  Monday week2:
      s0 -> 25lbs [16reps] (1 rir) [x]
      s1 -> 25lbs [16reps] (1 rir) [ ]
      s2 -> 25lbs [14reps] (1 rir) [ ]

  * Mesocycle
    * Days per Week training
    * Targeted Muscle Groups

  ... idk serialization data
  TrainingDay # of sets / muscle group
  what what completed vs what was skipped

Todo: much later
  * have a lbs to kgs option and an understanding how to change that in the DB... or if it needs to be changed
